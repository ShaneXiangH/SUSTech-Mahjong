# OOAD Final Pre

## project Review

Use four words to describe our project: **Large**，**Quick**，**Good**，**Not Saving**

### Large

-There are many things to achieve, for example
   -A complete network framework (Paste NetManager code)
     -Client
     - Server
   -Chat system
   -Mall system
   - Skill
   -Complete Mahjong flow
   - set up
   -SUSTech special sound background
   -In line with SUSTech's unique game rules (hu card method, faculty skills, entry standards, transfer standards, reward and punishment mechanism)
-I wrote a lot of documents, for example
   -NetManager documentation
   -Mahjong main logic implementation
   -c/s communication rules
-A lot of preparation in the early stage, for example
   -Mahjong rules
   -Music material screenshots
   -Picture material screenshots
-I learned a lot, for example
   -TCP communication principle
   -Sticky packets and half packets when sending messages
   -Optimize network speed in the transport layer
   -How to build a general network framework
   -Deploy the code to the server
   -Design mode (factory mode, singleton mode, observer mode)
   -Refactoring method (extract method)

### Quick

-We complete tasks on time and according to plan

-We have completed the suggestions provided by the teacher

### Total timeline

  #### Before the initial defense

  Collect material

  Define rules

  Construction of the network framework

  #### Interim reply

  Improve the rules according to the development process

  Completed the development of stand-alone Mahjong (UML diagram)

  #### Final defense

  Improve the functions of stand-alone Mahjong (follow the teacher’s mid-term suggestions and add computer skills)

  Integrated network framework and stand-alone Mahjong

  Deploy to the server

### Good

-Good UI design

-Our code structure is very good, using... design patterns, easy to extend
   -Design mode (factory mode, singleton mode, observer mode)
-We applied refactoring techniques
   -extract class
   -move method
   -rename method
-The games we make are meaningful
   -Read the preface, the meaningful part
-The rules are well designed and have the characteristics of SUSTech
   -Read the preface, the part of the rules

### Not Saving

-Renting a server, ui spends a lot of money and needs to be reimbursed
