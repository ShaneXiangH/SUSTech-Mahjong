# Foreword

## SUSTech MaJiang----your best companion

Our original intention was to provide a SUSTech campus-themed game product, allowing players to relax, entertain, and familiarize themselves with some of the school's rules. Socrates once said: "Games are a preview of life." We hope that players can add color to their lives by playing our games.

To cater to the fast-paced game atmosphere of the era of national games, our mahjong basic rules have made some changes to the traditional Chinese mahjong rules. In addition to the traditional winning method (straight + pair), here, if you have less than 10 cards in your hand, it can also be counted as a win.

In the game, you can enjoy the unique game interface of SUSTech style. From the simple and generous login interface to the elegant and dignified game lobby. Whether it's the amazing viewing angle when eating and touching the bar, you will be heartily, or the crazy reward of the next game will make you fascinated. "Long bridge lying on the wave, Weiyun Helong? The road goes empty, but the rainbow? High and low, I don't know the east and the west. The singing stage is warm and the spring is melting." A Fanggong has long been buried in the dust of history. middle. In contemporary times, SUSTech is aiming to become the most beautiful university campus in China. I believe you will have a splendid experience in the game that is better than living in Afang Palace.

In the game, you can become more familiar with the learning rules of SUSTech. SUSTech students do not need to choose a major in the first two years. If a student wants to choose his intended major in the junior year, he must learn the prerequisites for this major in the first two years. Our game simulates this process. We put the profession as a commodity in the mall, and different professions have different values. For example, the computer department is the most expensive, because the computer department requires the most professional prerequisites in the school, and the difficulty in entering the department is the most. Of course, there are other reasons. Value and price are always proportional. The high price of the computer department reflects that he is most sought after by his classmates. As a scarce resource, the computer department's increase in its selling price is also in line with the rules of today's market economy.

At the very beginning, the player was not in any department, it was a new generation of general education. By playing mahjong practice, you can earn gold coins that can represent your academic achievements. After the player has enough gold coins, he can buy a department as his profession. Each department has a different game gain effect, you can activate the corresponding skills. The skill of the mathematics department is "parasitic seed". You can view the N cards of a random person on the field (N = 14-rounds). The number of cards that can be viewed is related to time. The sooner you use this skill, you can see the number of cards. more. The skill of the Chemistry Department is "Pill Bead Rejuvenation", which can destroy a card in your hand and obtain a new card (chemical substance). The skill of the computer science department is "Big Speaking". You can play a card at will. This card can't enable the other three players to trigger the skill of eating and touching bars.

If the player has already selected a major, if he wants to choose another major, the gold coins required for the selected major will be higher than when the major was selected for the first time. This also echoes the higher threshold in reality that students must have a GPA of 3.3 or higher before they can change majors.

We regard every game as every class in SUSTech. You may not understand this lesson (losing this game), but you should also have a correct attitude and you should not leave early (quit the game halfway through). Once a student leaves early, a large number of credits (gold coins) will be deducted. There must be gains when you come, and students must be able to learn something. Even if you are the loser in this sentence, you will get 10 gold coins (sign in). Of course, the best if you win, you will get 60 gold coins.

The results of each match and the gold coins obtained will be recorded as the classmate's transcript and GPA.

In our game, the advancement of SUSTech’s plot is a long process. Each round is just a lesson. When you first play two or three rounds, you may not have a deep impression of it, and you may even think it is similar to a normal Mahjong game. The more you play, the more you can feel the subtleties of the game. Our games do not require fancy and gorgeous visual animations or sound effects. We start from the careful writing of every line of code, according to scientific design patterns and reconstruction methods, and strive to ensure the stability, fluency, and scalability of the game. The setting rhythm of the story plot is not particularly fast. We hope to make a product that players can play for a long time, and hope that it can become spiritual sustenance for players.

This game not only provides leisure and entertainment, but it is also a reflection of the real-life of SUSTech students.  For those who are new to college, they can familiarize themselves with school life through this game and better plan their future. For the old bacon who has already entered the major, you can also enrich your life experience by choosing other majors in the game, and experiencing the happiness and troubles of other majors. For the parents of SUSTech students, they can learn about their children’s university study life through games, increase common topics in chat, and promote the warmth and harmony of the family. For the administrators of SUSTech, they can also discover the irrationality in the design of the existing learning rules through games, revise a more suitable training plan, promote the construction of the school system, and help cultivate better talents. For the media and social people, this game can make them impressed by the beautiful scenery of SUSTech, help the school establish a good reputation in the society, increase social visibility, and increase the quality of students.

"Last night the westerly wind withered trees, alone on the tall buildings, looking across the world." Although our games can give life a touch of color and inspiration, games are always just games, and real-life is to struggle by yourself. I wish all the students of the University of Southern Science and Technology, academic success, and life smoothly. Now that I have chosen a far place, I will just leave it alone!
