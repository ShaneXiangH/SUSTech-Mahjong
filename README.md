# Foreword

## SUSTech MaJiang----your best companion

The original intention of our design is to provide a game product with the theme of the SUSTech campus, so that players can relax and entertain while familiarizing themselves with some of the university rules.

To make the game fast-paced, we made some changes to the traditional Chinese mahjong rules. In addition to traditional winning methods (straight + pair), in this game, if you have less than 10 cards in your hand, it can also be counted as a win.

In the game, you can enjoy the unique game interface of SUSTech style. From the simple and generous login interface, to the elegant and dignified game lobby. From the hearty animations of eating, pairing, and long pairing, to the crazy rewards when you win. SUSTech aims to become the most beautiful university campus in China. We believe you can feel the beauty of SUSTech through the exquisite interface in the game.

While playing our games, you can become more familiar with the learning rules of SUSTech. SUSTech students do not need to decide on majors in the first two years. However, if a student wants to successfully enter his intended major in his junior year, he must complete the prerequisite courses required by this major in the first two years. Our game simulates this process: We regard the majors in the university as commodities in the game mall. Different majors require different purchase prices. For example, the majors in the computer science department are the most expensive, since the computer science department requires the most number of prerequisite courses, and it is the most difficult department to enter. 

In the beginning, players are not in any department. They are freshmen in general education. By playing mahjong, players earn gold coins, which represents their academic achievements. After a player has enough gold coins, he can buy a major in the game store as his major in the university. Different majors have different game buffs. For example, the buff of the mathematic major is "parasitic seed", the player in math major can view N cards of a random counterplayer (N = 14-number of rounds). The buff of the chemistry major is "Danzhu Rejuvenation", which can destroy a card in his hand and obtain a new card (chemical reaction has occurred). The buff of the computer science major is "Speaking of the Master". The player in CS major can play any card, and this card cannot enable the other three players to trigger the skills of eating, pairing, or long pairing.

When a player already has chosen a major and wants to choose another major, the new major requires him with higher gold coins than the time he chooses this major when he is in general education status. This rule corresponds to the higher threshold in reality that students must have a GPA of 3.3 or higher before they can change majors.

We regard every game as a class in SUSTech. A student may not understand the teaching content in this lesson (losing this game), but he should still have a good attitude and not leave the class early (quit the game midway). Once a student leaves early, a large number of credits (gold coins) will be penalized. As long as the student comes to the class, he will gain something. Even if he is the loser in this round, he will get 10 gold coins, simulating checking the attendance, in reality. Finally, the player's scores and gold coins obtained in each match will be recorded as the transcript and GPA.

This game not only provides students leisure and entertainment, but also reflects SUSTech students' real life. We hope the game be helpful to all kinds of persons in the university. Freshmen can play this game to familiarize themselves with the university’s academic rules, to better plan their future. Those who entered a major can enrich their life experience by choosing other majors in the game, to explore the happiness and troubles in other majors. Parents of SUSTech students can learn about their children’s college life through games. Administrators in SUSTech may also be able to notice some potential irrationality of existing learning rules by playing games. For persons in society, this game can make them impressed by the beautiful scenery of SUSTech.

Finally, We want to remind that although the game is interesting, it is just a game. Real-life is still to struggle on your own. We wish all the students of SUSTech to have academic success and great endeavors!
